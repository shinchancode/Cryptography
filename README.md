# Cryptography
Cryptography project : The project is based on a cryptography technique that uses Double layer encryption and decryption using Armstrong numbers and RGB color-based mappings for various types of file format. The idea is inspired from [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5738822) research paper. 
#
Various modifications, like use of mathematical formulae for increasing the time efficiency for traversal of matrices, are applied to the ideas presented in the paper
#
## A java Program that enables Double layer encryption and decryption of data using Armstrong Numbers and RGB color model for various types of file format.

## Cryptography
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. 

These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email.

## Symmetric-key
Single-key or symmetric-key encryption algorithms create a fixed length of bits known as a block cipher with a secret key that the creator/sender uses to encipher data (encryption) and the receiver uses to decipher it. 

One example of symmetric-key cryptography is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a specification established in November 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 197) to protect sensitive information. 

The standard is mandated by the U.S. government and widely used in the private sector..
