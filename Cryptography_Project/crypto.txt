encoding matrix//cubegeneration or matrix of size 3*16*16

104: nibble creation
highr nibble row
lower nibble nibble col
intersection is val

nibble val is 0-15 and size of matrix is also 0-15 rows and 0-15 cols


lessons from paper;
symmetric key and apply operation on evry byte armstrong no use and matrix creation but in paper complexity was ncube 

in our it is encryption is o(n)
in decryption is o(1)

the val at row and col is our original data xor it and get val.
